**RootlessViPER4Android** (RootlessJamesDSP — ViPER4Android Edition) is a system-wide **Android equalizer and audio effects app** that brings the beloved **ViPER4Android (V4A)** sound experience to **non-rooted phones**. It combines the powerful open-source **JamesDSP** engine with native re-implementations of ViPER's classic effects — Dynamic System, ViPER Bass, ViPER Clarity, Spectrum Extension, Field Surround, Tube Simulator (6N1J) and many more — all running **without root, without Magisk, and without custom ROMs**.

Beyond the ViPER suite, it adds a **fully reorderable DSP chain**, so you decide the order every effect runs in, with the output limiter always kept last. An **interactive parametric equalizer** lets you drag bands directly on the response curve, add or remove them with a long press, and fine-tune frequency, Q and gain on rotary controls with full undo. A **studio-grade echo/delay** offers mono, stereo and ping-pong modes with a filtered feedback path, sample-rate and bit-depth crushing, tape-style modulation, diffusion and feedback distortion — all laid out on a knob panel that reflows to fit any screen. **Up to four Liveprog (EEL2) scripts** can be chained together and picked in one multi-select pass, and **446 official ViPER DDC profiles** are bundled and ready to load.

The interface is yours to arrange: **reorder, hide and group the effect cards**, search across every effect, and save the whole setup — including your layout and chain order — into portable presets. Effect cards load as you scroll so the app opens instantly, and large effect buffers are allocated only while an effect is switched on, keeping memory use modest even with many apps playing audio.

## ✨ Features

### 🐍 ViPER4Android effect suite (native ports)
Arranged in the classic V4A order:

| Effect | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Playback gain control (AGC)** | Evens out quiet/loud tracks automatically |
| **FET compressor** | Punchy studio-style compression |
| **ViPER-DDC** | Headphone correction profiles — **446 official DDC files bundled!** |
| **Spectrum extension** | Restores sparkle & air to compressed music |
| **FIR equalizer** | Precision fixed-band EQ |
| **Convolver** | Impulse response processing |
| **Field surround** | Widens the stereo field naturally |
| **Differential surround** | Classic V4A channel-delay surround |
| **Headphone surround +** | Speakers-in-a-room simulation for headphones |
| **Reverberation** | Full room reverb (size, damping, width, wet/dry) |
| **Dynamic system** | ViPER Dynamic Bass with all **19 original device presets** + custom mode |
| **Tube simulator (6N1J)** | Warm analog tube saturation (up to 24 dB drive) |
| **ViPER bass** | Natural / Pure Bass+ / Subwoofer modes |
| **ViPER clarity** | Natural / OZone+ / XHiFi treble enhancement |
| **Auditory system protection (Cure+)** | Anti-fatigue crossfeed for long sessions |
| **Speaker optimization** | Corrective tuning for phone speakers |

### 🎚 Plus the full JamesDSP toolkit
Output limiter (with selectable peak / soft-saturation modes), auto-loudness compander, bass boost, **dual-band psychoacoustic bass exciter**, stereo widener, crossfeed, virtual room reverb, arbitrary-response graphic EQ (AutoEQ import), and a scriptable **Liveprog (EEL2)** engine.

### 💜 Quality-of-life
- Plain-language "ℹ️ what is this?" explainers on every section
- Smart UI: irrelevant sliders hide automatically
- Crash-safe DSP dispatch with built-in diagnostics
- Works per-app, session-based — no audio HAL patching

## 🆕 Added & changed vs. upstream RootlessJamesDSP

**Added in this fork:**
- 🐍 **16 native ViPER4Android effect sections** (see table above) — including brand-new engine code for Dynamic System, ViPER Bass, Clarity, FET Compressor, Cure+, Field/Differential/Headphone Surround, Reverberation, Spectrum Extension, AGC & Speaker Optimization
- 🔊 **Dual-band psychoacoustic bass exciter** — two independently tunable harmonic bands (the second band hides until you enable it)
- 🛡 **Selectable output limiter modes**: classic peak limiter, smooth **soft-saturation** (tanh) mode, or fully off
- 🎧 **446 official ViPER-DDC correction files bundled** and auto-installed on first launch
- ℹ️ Collapsible plain-language explainers on every effect section
- 🧰 Built-in crash diagnostics: native + JVM crash reports auto-copied to clipboard on next launch

**Changed & fixed:**
- 🔥 **Tube simulator actually works now** — upstream divided the drive value by 100 before it reached the engine (max ≈ 0.12 dB, inaudible); fixed and range extended to **24 dB**
- 🐛 Fixed a crash when seekbars use a `%` unit label
- 🪄 Smart UI: Dynamic System custom sliders only appear in Custom mode; irrelevant controls stay hidden
- 🗂 All ViPER-equivalent sections renamed to their **authentic V4A titles** and reordered into the classic V4A layout under a dedicated header
- ➖ Removed the redundant Parametric EQ card (Arbitrary-response/graphic EQ covers it)
- 📛 App renamed to **RootlessViPER4Android** (installs alongside the original RootlessJamesDSP)

## 🗺 Roadmap

Requested by the community, in rough priority order:

- **Global "Poweramp-style" mode** — process the whole output mix with Android's built-in effect API instead of audio capture: no capture permission, no persistent notification, and apps that block capture (Spotify) would work. Trade-off: only EQ/bass/limiter-class effects can run there — the ViPER effects need the capture engine. Deprecated by Google and device-dependent (works on many Samsungs, often not Pixels), so it'll ship clearly labelled as experimental.
- **Custom effect groups** — create, rename and hide your own groups; drag cards between them
- **Search, sorting & hiding on the presets screen**
- **Chained Liveprog scripts** — multi-select scripts and get one card per script, chained in order
- **Rooted mode** — for devices with the JamesDSP magisk module (testers welcome!)
- **Minimum-phase toggle** for the graphic EQ

## 📲 Download & Install
1. Grab the latest APK from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/alienware377/RootlessJamesDSP-ViPER4Android-Edition/releases) page (or fresh builds from [Actions](https://github.com/alienware377/RootlessJamesDSP-ViPER4Android-Edition/actions)).
2. Install and follow the in-app onboarding — it walks you through the permission setup step-by-step.
3. Play music, open the app, and start flipping switches 🎶

Installs **alongside** the original RootlessJamesDSP as a separate app — keep both or remove the original, your choice.

## ⚠️ Limitations
Rootless audio capture on Android has inherent restrictions (inherited from upstream RootlessJamesDSP):
* Apps that block internal audio capture (some streaming apps, e.g. Spotify) are unaffected unless patched
* Calls and protected media may bypass processing
* A persistent capture notification is required by Android

See the [upstream documentation](https://github.com/timschneeberger/RootlessJamesDSP) for details and workarounds.

## ❓ FAQ
**Is this really ViPER4Android?**
The original V4A is closed-source and requires root. This project re-implements its most-loved effects natively on top of the JamesDSP engine — same spirit, same workflow, zero root.

**Do I need Magisk / a custom kernel / a driver install?**
Nope. Nothing to flash, no "driver" status screen, no SELinux tricks.

**Will it work on Android 13/14/15?**
It targets modern Android and is tested on current versions. If something breaks, open an issue with the in-app crash report.
